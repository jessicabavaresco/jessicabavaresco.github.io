  abstract = {Using quantum systems as sensors or probes has been shown to greatly improve the precision of parameter estimation by exploiting unique quantum features such as entanglement. A major task in quantum sensing is to design the optimal protocol, i.e., the most precise one. It has been solved for some specific instances of the problem, but in general even numerical methods are not known. Here, we focus on the single-shot Bayesian setting, where the goal is to find the optimal initial state of the probe (which can be entangled with an auxiliary system), the optimal measurement, and the optimal estimator function. We leverage the formalism of higher-order operations to develop a method based on semidefinite programming that finds a protocol that is close to the optimal one with arbitrary precision. Crucially, our method is not restricted to any specific quantum evolution, cost function or prior distribution, and thus can be applied to any estimation problem. Moreover, it can be applied to both single or multiparameter estimation tasks. We demonstrate our method with three examples, consisting of unitary phase estimation, thermometry in a bosonic bath, and multiparameter estimation of an SU(2) transformation. Exploiting our methods, we extend several results from the literature. For example, in the thermometry case, we find the optimal protocol at any finite time and quantify the usefulness of entanglement. Additionally, we show that when the cost function is the mean squared error, projective measurements are optimal for estimation.},

  abstract = {Quantum processes are transformations that act on quantum operations. Their study led to the discovery of the phenomenon of indefinite causal order: some quantum processes, such as the quantum switch, act on independent quantum operations in such a way that the order in which the operations are acted upon not only cannot be determined but is simply undefined. This is the property that we experimentally certify in this work. We report an experimental certification of indefinite causal order that relies only on the characterization of the operations of a single party. We do so in the semi-device-independent scenario with the fewest possible assumptions of characterization of the parties' local operations in which indefinite causal order can be demonstrated with the quantum switch. To achieve this result, we introduce the concept of semi-device-independent causal inequalities and show that the correlations generated in a photonic quantum switch, in which all parties are able to collect local outcome statistics, achieve a violation of this inequality of 224 standard deviations. This result consists of the experimental demonstration of indefinite causal order with the fewest device-characterization assumptions to date.},

  abstract = {The capacity of distant parties to send signals to one another is a fundamental requirement in many information-processing tasks. Such ability is determined by the causal structure connecting the parties, and more generally, by the intermediate processes carrying signals from one laboratory to another. Here we build a fully fledged resource theory of causal connection for all multi-party communication scenarios, encompassing those where the parties operate in a definite causal order and also where the order is indefinite. We define and characterize the set of free processes and three different sets of free transformations thereof, resulting in three distinct resource theories of causal connection. In the causally ordered setting, we identify the most resourceful processes in the bipartite and tripartite scenarios. In the general setting, instead, our results suggest that there is no global most valuable resource. We establish the signalling robustness as a resource monotone of causal connection and provide tight bounds on it for many pertinent sets of processes. Finally, we introduce a resource theory of causal non-separability, and show that it is ? in contrast to the case of causal connection ? unique. Together our results offer a flexible and comprehensive framework to quantify and transform general quantum processes, as well as insights into their multi-layered causal connection structures.},

  abstract = {Entanglement shared among multiple parties presents complex challenges for the characterisation of different types of entanglement. One of the most fundamental insights is the fact that some mixed states can feature entanglement across every possible cut of a multipartite system yet can be produced via a mixture of states separable with respect to different partitions. To distinguish states that genuinely cannot be produced from mixing such partition-separable states, the term
genuine multipartite entanglement was coined. All these considerations originate in a paradigm where only a single copy of the state is distributed and locally acted upon. In contrast, advances in quantum technologies prompt the question of how this picture changes when multiple copies of the same state become locally accessible. Here we show that multiple copies unlock genuine multipartite entanglement from partially separable states, i.e., mixtures of the partition-separable states, even from undistillable ensembles, and even more than two copies can be required to observe this effect. With these findings, we characterise the notion of genuine multipartite entanglement in the paradigm of multiple copies and conjecture a strict hierarchy of activatable states and an asymptotic collapse of the hierarchy.},

  abstract = {When transforming pairs of independent quantum operations according to the fundamental rules of quantum theory, an intriguing phenomenon emerges: some such higher-order operations may act on the input operations in an indefinite causal order. Recently, the formalism of process matrices has been developed to investigate these noncausal properties of higher-order operations. This formalism predicts, in principle, statistics that ensure indefinite causal order even in a device-independent scenario, where the involved operations are not characterised. Nevertheless, all physical implementations of process matrices proposed so far require full characterisation of the involved operations in order to certify such phenomena. Here we consider a semi-device-independent scenario, which does not require all operations to be characterised. We introduce a framework for certifying noncausal properties of process matrices in this intermediate regime and use it to analyse the quantum switch, a well-known higher-order operation, to show that, although it can only lead to causal statistics in a device-independent scenario, it can exhibit noncausal properties in semi-device-independent scenarios. This proves that the quantum switch generates stronger noncausal correlations than it was previously known.},

    abstract = {High-dimensional encoding of quantum information provides a way of transcending the limitations of current approaches to quantum communication, which are mostly based on the entanglement between qubits—two-dimensional quantum systems. One of the central challenges in the pursuit of high-dimensional alternatives is ascertaining the presence of high-dimensional entanglement within a given high-dimensional quantum state. In particular, it would be desirable to carry out such entanglement certification without resorting to inefficient full state tomography. Here, we show how carefully constructed measurements in two bases (one of which is not orthonormal) can be used to faithfully and efficiently certify bipartite high-dimensional states and their entanglement for any physical platform. To showcase the practicality of this approach under realistic conditions, we put it to the test for photons entangled in their orbital angular momentum. In our experimental set-up, we are able to verify 9-dimensional entanglement for a pair of photons on a 11-dimensional subspace each, at present the highest amount certified without any assumptions on the state.},

While the motion of the atoms in the surface plane is treated with a standard two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulation, the model takes into consideration the thermal excitation of quantum states associated with surface-normal dynamics in an attempt to describe the apparent smoothing of the corrugation with increasing temperature. We examine the importance of this thermal smoothing to the relative stability of several observed and proposed low-temperature structures. Structure factor calculations are compared to experimental results in an attempt to determine the low temperature structure of this system. These calculations provide strong evidence that, at very low temperatures, the domain wall structure of a xenon monolayer adsorbed on a Pt(111) substrate possesses a chaotic-like nature, exhibiting long-lived meta-stable states with pinned domain walls, these walls having narrow widths and irregular shapes. This result is contrary to the standard wisdom regarding this system, namely, that the very low temperature phase of this system is a striped incommensurate phase. We present the case for further experimental investigation of this and similar systems as possible examples of chaotic low temperature phases in two dimensions.},

Well-known concepts such as joint measurability and projective simulability naturally emerge as particular cases of our framework, but our study also leads to novel results and questions. First, a generalisation of joint measurability is derived, which yields a hierarchy for the incompatibility of sets of measurements. A similar hierarchy is defined based on the number of outcomes necessary to perform a simulation of a given measurement. This general approach also allows us to identify connections between different kinds of simulability and, in particular, we characterise the qubit measurements that are projective-simulable in terms of joint measurability.

We exploit hyperentanglement, that is, simultaneous entanglement in polarization and energy-time bases, to encode quantum information, and observe high-visibility interference for successive correlation measurements in each degree of freedom. These visibilities impose lower bounds on entanglement in each subspace individually and certify four-dimensional entanglement for the hyperentangled system.
