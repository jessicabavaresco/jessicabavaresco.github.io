I am thrilled to have joined the Quantum Information team at LIP6 as a permanent CNRS researcher! Check out all the interesting researcher the team does on our website: <a href='https://qi.lip6.fr'>https://qi.lip6.fr<a/>. We are the the Sorbonne University campus in Jussieu, in the lovely center of Paris.
