Hi, my name is Jessica Bavaresco. I'm a quantum information scientist. Currently, I'm a post-doctoral researcher carrying out an <a href='https://www.snf.ch/en/m1NtWp4nTELQixlu/funding/horizon-europe-swiss-postdoctoral-fellowships'>SNSF Swiss Post-doctoral Fellowship</a> in the group of Prof. Nicolas Brunner at the Unniversity of Geneva, Switzerland.

I obtained a PhD in Physics from the University of Vienna, Austria, in 2021.
