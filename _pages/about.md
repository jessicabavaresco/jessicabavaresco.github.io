Hi, my name is Jessica Bavaresco. As of 2025, I'm a permanent research scientist (<em>CNRS chargée de recherche</em>) in the <a href='https://qi.lip6.fr'>QI team</a> at <a href='https://www.lip6.fr/jessica.bavaresco'>LIP6,</a> a CNRS & Sorbonne University computer science laboratory in Paris, France. I work with quantum information science.

My main research interests are in higher-order operations and quantum correlations. Some of the topics I have worked on recently involve quantum networks, Bell nonlocality, channel discrimination, genuine multipartite entanglement, metrology, boxworld correlations, and indefinite causal order.

I was previously a SNSF Swiss Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Geneva, Switzerland (2022-2025) and before that, I was a postdoc in the Young Independent Research Group (YIRG) at IQOQI Vienna, Austria (2021-2022). I obtained a PhD in physics at the University of Vienna, Austria, in 2021. 

Here you will find a collection of all my papers and theses, code repositories, some of my talks and posters, my CV, and recent news.
