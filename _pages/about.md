Hi, my name is Jessica Bavaresco. I'm a quantum information scientist. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href='https://www.unige.ch/gap/qic/theory/team'>group</a> of Prof. Nicolas Brunner at the University of Geneva, Switzerland. Starting in October 2023, I will be carrying out an <a href='https://www.snf.ch/en/m1NtWp4nTELQixlu/funding/horizon-europe-swiss-postdoctoral-fellowships'>SNSF Swiss Post-doctoral Fellowship</a> in the same group.

I obtained a PhD in Physics from the University of Vienna, Austria, in 2021.

My main research interests are in higher-order operations and quantum correlations. Some of the topics I have worked on recently involve channel discrimination, genuine multipartite entanglement, metrology, boxworld correlations, and causality in quantum mechanics.

Here you will find a collection of all my papers and theses, code repositories, some of my talks and posters, my CV, and recent news.
